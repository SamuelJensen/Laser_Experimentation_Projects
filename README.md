# Laser_Experimentation_Projects
Repositiory for projects in the Laser Experimentation area. The current commit contains a collection of files to act as a back-up incase fusion takes a dive. Everything fits on 2020 or 2040 aluminum rails.

***Note that improper usage of laser systems may cause harm to the user and those viewing the experiment. Proper safety precautions should be in place before utilizing and powering a laser system. Even low wattage lasers may cause harm to the user.

The first set of f3d files are only used by Autodesk fusion360. The stl and step files will be uploaded at somepoint to follow up.


The following needs completed this week

* Format the directory to fit our working directory at home
* Upload flexure system for laser pointing
